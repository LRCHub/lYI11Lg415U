(This is $crim beats)
Yuh
Yeah yeah that's better
Uh
Seventh ward
Uh uh Oddy Nuff the Snow Leopard
Smokin hash, smokin cash
Aight let's go with Getta

If. if, if, if- if smokin' weed makes you dumb
then why not get some brain
when you smoke that blunt?
Round it up, fill it up, roll it up, light it up,
Pass it over here 'cuz I only hit it once
Don't let it run
I'm blowin' smoke rings
while your bitch is overdosin' on my nuts
Oh bad bitches (?)
Wait, bitch, hog all the blunt,
Then let's roll another up
Yup
I harvest all my crystals like apartheid
Look like diamond, diamonds on my weed
It makes the gang shine
But it could be
Just a promethazine
We painted on the (?) side
Slowly burnin', movin' slowly, hurlin'
Fuck, I'm fucked up
Eyes redder than the cherry paint on my fuckin' caught car
Bitch please
The way we movin' we ain't goin' far
This that shit that you was wildin,
Smoke you up and all that you can say is what tje fuck?
What the fuck?
You look like my grandma
This weed must be too good
Shit, son, you buggin' me out
maybe I should've bought you some reggie bush
Get the image in my weed look like Grimace (?)
Program progressin' they think I'm a menace
So high I look like I just left the dentist
Smokin' that weed that I bought from a chemist

(Can rent it if she can't afford it)
(I guess, I mean.)

That's right
You know it
You know it
Yuh
Leggo
Gotta sack of that dope
Smokin' with a couple bitches
Laid back, gettin throat
While I'm blowin' down on that Swisher
Double cup, pour it up
Take that Activas in that Swisher
Got these bitches catchin' up
This that old school triple six shit
Riding slammed in the (?)
Blowin' sacks of marijuana
Poppin pills, poppin' pills
Poppin so much dope that I'm in a coma
Smoke a sack, smoke a sack
Take that dope straight to the head
Smoke a sack, smoke a sack
It's G9 until I'm dead
Backpack with that work,
Got that heroin all that cocaine
Sack fat, got them grams
Dirty D with that work, mane
Backpack with that work,
Got that heroin all that cocaine
Sack fat, got them grams
Dirty D with that work mane
