(Krizz Kaliko)
After the party it's the after party
And after that it's the hotel lobby
And after that it's probably Krizz
It's probably Krizz (Kali!)

Hee-haw ack-a-donkey (x3)
Hee-haw kick it like a donkey!

I'm off the crown
Feet off the ground
Get off the clear
Get on the brown

So intoxicated!
So belligerent, ignorant
Security hate it!
But they just gotta live with it
Cause we suited up, boot it up
Chew it up, iced out
Trying to find this is right now
We turn the lights out
Fights outside
In the inside we fixin' it
Any problem you got KCT is your defensin' it.

Oh yea, Bout to ack-a-donkey
We ain't letting those girls go past!
And if we off the Caribou Lou
We ack a donkey
That means we act a fool with it
Who wit it?

Hee-haw ack-a-donkey (x3)
Hee-haw kick it like a donkey!

Hee-haw ack-a-donkey (x3)
Hee-haw kick it like a donkey!

Who's up?
To the club
Too bad
In the black and red Chevy on slap
Cops trippin with me saying i be breaking the penal code
Booties all around me so my brain switch to hyena mode
Red turf stomp - the opposite of a L7.
Jolly Green giant - my pockets look like a head of lettuce.
Two litres of hennesy and patron
White folks (look up) looks like a communion is being hown

Everybody off in the parking lot getting F'ed up
All you see is niggas and women liftin' their dress up
Kickin' it like a donkey some is trying to impress us
But we don't pay the cross no attention, you silly heifas!

Hee-haw ack-a-donkey (x3)
Hee-haw kick it like a donkey!

(Krizz Kaliko)
I ack a donkey (donkey)
The women kinda want me
They know who I is so the punks want to jump me
I pay them no never mind
They girlies fine
(Biggy tribute)
And as soon buy that wine I just creep up from behind
And ask them what they interest are
And who they be with
Who they came with
I know who they leave with
I'm sorta local star so they conceded
People just know who I are, can you believe it?
Kick it like a donkey donkey
Swing it like a monkey monkey
When I'm gettin' drunk I feel like everyone want me.
Shorty you go like this it's your birthday
I'm trying to get to know you and you know in the worst way!
And ack-a-donkey!

Hee-haw ack-a-donkey (x3)
Hee-haw kick it like a donkey!

When we
Hee-haw ack-a-dobvey (x3)
Hee-haw kick it like a donkey!

Like a donkey! Hee-haw!
